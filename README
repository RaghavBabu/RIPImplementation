RIPv2 Protocol:

Compile and Run:
----------------------

javac -d PROJECT_PATH/bin/  PROJECT_PATH/src/*.java
cd ~/PROJECT_PATH/bin
java Router(add package name separated with dot if available Ex: edu.rit.rip.Router)

Note : You need to enter the respective router name inside Router main class before compiling the java classes.
String routerName = <ROUTER NAME>

Functionalities :
------------------

Make changes in topology.xml file to alter the topology and link cost.

1) Each Router has a Server and Client.
	Server sends the local table to all neighbors upon request from respective client.
	Client request for table from neighboring nodes and updates its local table to build the final routing table.
	
2)Local intermediate table is updated with shortest path to all other networks.

3)Each table maintains a routing table with next hop router,destination network prefix, cost and subnet mask.

4)Intermediate table is updated continuously and final routing table is made.

So final result will be routing table with shortest path and next hop route to the network(CIDR address).

NOTE : Route Failure Case not handled.
